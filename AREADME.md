Impact of Travel on Performance in Hockey  

By Keegan Macumber  

 

 

Executive Summary  

This project takes a dive into the importance of travel in hockey and how it can impact performance. This impact can negatively affect performance by causing fatigue due to disrupted sleep patterns from time changes, leading to slower reaction times, lower energy levels, and even an increased risk of injury. Travelling long distances across numerous time zones is very common in professional hockey leagues. Indicators that fatigue can take effect on include Points Per Game (PPG), Time on ice (TOI), win percentage after travel days, Goals per game, as well as fatigue indicators including turnovers in the game, injuries, slower reaction time and speed.
