# Impact of Travel on Performance in Hockey  

*By Keegan Macumber* 

## Executive Summary  

This project takes a dive into the importance of travel in hockey and how it can impact performance. This impact can negatively affect performance by causing fatigue due to disrupted sleep patterns from time changes, leading to slower reaction times, lower energy levels, and even an increased risk of injury<mark>(Cite)</mark>. Travelling long distances across numerous time zones is very common in professional hockey leagues. Fatigue has the potential to affect ~~Indicators that fatigue can take effect on include~~ Points Per Game (PPG), Time on ice (TOI), win percentage after travel days, Goals per game, as well as fatigue indicators including turnovers in the game, injuries, slower reaction time and speed.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
<mark>We need more here, for example, a value statement of why PPG is a valuable indidicator, and what can we do with it, answer the "so what" question.</mark>

**Points Per Game (PPG)**

PPG provides a straightforward metric to evaluate a player's scoring ability and overall contribution to the team's offensive performance.  It allows for comparison between players, helping to identify who is the most effective scorer in a league, team, or position.  Tracking changes in PPG can help assess the impact of injuries on a player's performance and recovery.

Technical Details:
* Range: 0-30?
* Frequency: Per game
  
**Time on ice (TOI)**

2. Win percentage after travel days 

3. Goals per game  

4. Fatigue indicators (turnovers, etc.)
