# Background 

The National Hockey League (NHL) is one of the most physically demanding professional sport leagues, with teams playing up to 82 games in a regular season. Each game consists of three 20-minute periods, not inlcuding over time and shootout. Beyond the phyical aspect of the game, one of the most significant player performance influencers is the extensive travel schedule of the league (Kneeland, 2014). 

Unlike other major sport leagues, like the NFL, where teams play once a week, NHL teams play multiple games in a week. This includes back-to-back games on consecutive nights. The league's structure requires frequent time changes and cross country travel, exposing players to varying time zones and significant disruptions in their recovery process (MacIntyre, 2008). Trvael fatigue is a well-documented challenge for NHL athletes, as long flights bus rides, late-night travels, and early morning deoartures contribute to irregular sleep patterns and increased phycial exhaustion. Players often check into hotel hotel rooms at odd hours and must adjust to different sleeping environments, which can further effect their ability to recover between games.

The impact of travel is more frequent for teams located in the western division. For example teams like the Vancouver Canucks and LA Kings must travel throusands of miles throught the season to face opponents in the Eastern Conference, particulary Eastern Canadian teams like the Ottawa Senators, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Montreal Canadians who have more geographically compact travel schedules due to closer proximety of divisional rivals. Ultimetely, studies show that travel-related fatigue can lead to decreased reaction time, impaired decision-making, and increased risk of injury. The combination of these factors makes it more challenging for players to maintain peak performance consistently throughout the season. This theory also contributes to the widely recognized home-ice advantage, where teams playing in familiar environemnts with routine schedules tend to perform better than visiting teams suffering from travel induced fatigue (Charest, 2022).

Overall, the demanding travel schedule in the NHL is a crucial factor that influences team performance, player endurance, and overal competitiveness. Strategies such as optimizing recovery protocols, adjusting practice schedulesm and utilizing sport science innovations are continually being exlored to help mitigate the effects of travel on NHL athletes.
