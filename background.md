# Background 

The National Hockey League (NHL) is a physically demanding league where players can play up to 82 games. Each game is 3 20-minute periods, not including overtime and shootout if necessary. One of the most significant factors affecting player performance is the grueling travel induced in the 82-game schedule<mark>(cite)</mark>. The NHL features extensive cross-country travel, time change zones, and back-to-back games. These are all major factors that <mark>may impact</mark> performance. Travel disrupts athletes' recovery process which is essential to reach peak performance. NHL teams play multiple road games in a week, sometimes in different time zones, this requires long flights and bus rides. Additionally late nights, early morning, hotel stays and irregular sleep schedules<mark>not a sentence</mark>. All of these factors lead to a home-ice advantage as well as travel disparities<mark>cite, or say we will find out if...</mark>. A ~~big~~ notable example ~~I found~~ to demonstrate travelling distance is that Western Conference teams such as the Vancouver Canucks or LA kings often have to travel long ~~periods of times~~<mark>Canadians tend to measure distance using "time", but just say *long distances*</mark> to play Eastern Conference teams like Toronto and Montreal.
